        <p>
          The origin of Morarka Foundation’s field activities from Nawalgarh, a semi-arid region on the periphery of the
          Thar Desert in India, has been a blessing in disguise. Extreme climates, very high temperatures, less than
          500mm annual rainfall with only about 20 rainy days in a year, undulating lands, sandy soils and very little
          water for irrigation offered perfect conditions for testing the new technologies and methodologies for
          organic management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anything which could succeed here would have a very high success potential elsewhere, and this has been
          amply evident in the overall success achieved in the last 10 years. Beginning with just about 500 farmers,
          today there are now over 1,00,000 farmers spread all over India cultivating over 2,50,000 acres land under
          organic management. These farmers are producing over 300 different crops, out of which over 100 crops have
          already been brought under the organic value chain management.
        </p>

        <p>
          Agriculture in Nawalgarh has not been remunerative enough due to monsoon failures every five years completely
          eroding the capacity to invest in agriculture. Most farmers would cultivate few cereals, pulses and oil seed
          crops, with only about 15–20 percent of the area under irrigation during winter cropping.
        </p>

        <p>
          The best asset was the availability of milk from animals on all the farms, though a large portion of animal
          dung was diverted for household fuel needs. In such a situation, addressing the fertility management issues
          and promotion of economical water use was very important.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first breakthrough was development of Vermiculture Technology. After experimenting with the process at
          the lab-scale, within about six months there were about 500 farmers who joined the experiments at the field
          level. In just one and a half year this technology was found successful and adopted by over 10,000 farmers,
          forming the basis for the introduction of one of the largest organic agricultural programme anywhere in
          India.
        </p>

        <p>
          Morarka Organic was quick to identify farmers for whom organic cultivation was an opportunity. Conversion to
          organic could not be the best option for every farmer in every place. Based on its experimentations at
          Nawalgarh, Morarka Organic identified the most suitable farmers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Under the guidance of Morarka Organic, farmers were encouraged to use their own farm inputs, follow
          traditional crop patterns and rely on indigenous knowledge. Biological fertility management reduced pest
          incidence, improved soil structure and enhanced crop quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a result there was a 10–25% reduction in the cost of cultivation, a 10–20% increase in price realization
          and nearly 30% higher profits in the first year itself.

      <p>
        Encouraged by the success achieved, many state agencies also got interested in this model. With their
        support, the vermiculture know-how was disseminated through local entrepreneurs, expanding this programme
        to over 300 villages in many parts of Rajasthan. This programme was also dovetailed with the Watershed
        Development Program, enrolling over 25,000 farmers in just two years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Subsequently, Morarka Organic received another major collaboration in the form of funding support from the
        Department of Bio-Technology (DBT), Government of India. Beginning from Rajasthan to increase the production
        of wheat, DBT invited Morarka Organic immediately after the earthquake in Kutch, Gujarat. As a result, one
        of the largest certified organic fruit growing regions producing Papaya, Guava, Mango and Banana was
        established in India.
      </p>

      <p>
        By this time, Morarka Organic had also established strong business linkages for certified organic crops.
        Buyers and exporters began demanding a wider range of crops and larger quantities. This led to the adoption
        of a new approach focused on building a complete kitchen food basket for Indian households.
      </p>

      <p>
        In total, about 30 new projects were launched across the country. For almost all these projects, support
        came either from state agencies or private sector companies and exporters, ensuring partial funding and
        strong local acceptance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certified organic cereals such as Wheat, Corn and Millets, pulses including Moong bean, Black gram, Horse
        gram and Moth, oilseeds like Mustard, Groundnut and Til, and spices such as Cumin, Coriander and Fennel are
        the direct outcomes of these initiatives.
