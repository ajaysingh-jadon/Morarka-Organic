            Today almost everyone is suffering from health problems related to stomach, indigestion,
            loss of energy, overall and general tiredness. When we compare the health and appetite of
            our ancestors and previous generations, the difference is obvious.

            <p>
              Almost all mothers complain that their children are not eating well enough. We feel
              heavy even if we’ve consumed small portions of food. Almost every day, scientific
              evidence links diseases such as diabetes, heart strokes and cancers to the food being
              produced and consumed today.
            </p>

            <p>
              A large number of young professionals gain weight even while eating less. Surely, the
              food we eat has a direct role in these growing health concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Organic food is free from the potent cocktail of fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides
              and other chemicals used in conventional farming. Chemical preservation methods are not
              permitted, making organic food safer and healthier.
            </p>

            <p>
              For many consumers, organic food tastes better. Traditional seed varieties and naturally
              suitable cultivation areas help deliver the true taste of food, unlike synthetic flavors
              produced through artificial inputs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Over the last two decades globally and the last decade in India, demand for certified
              organic food has grown steadily. Market surveys, consumer studies and focused interviews
              consistently reflect this trend.

              <h5>What Makes Organic Food Different?</h5>

              <p>
                Organic food is a sincere attempt to improve the quality of life through what we eat.
                It is contamination-free in terms of toxic chemicals and handled in a way that makes
                it completely adulteration-free.
              </p>

              <p>
                Every stage of the value chain — cultivation, procurement, storage and processing —
                is verified by independent third-party certification agencies. Organic food is sold
                only in sealed packs carrying certification logos, making it one of the most closely
                monitored foods available.

          The average consumer is becoming more and more cautious about the quality of food,

                heart diseases, osteoporosis, migraines and hyperactivity. Use of antibiotics, anti-microbial, hormones
                and other growth promoters are prohibited in organic production. Similarly use of synthetic chemicals as
                preservatives & colouring are prohibited in the processing of organic foods.

                Studies have indicated that most conventionally farmed foods have pesticide and other chemical residues.
                Over 400 chemicals are routinely used in conventional farming and research shows that 60% of herbicides,
                30% of insecticides and 90% of fungicides are known to cause cancer. These chemicals can also lead to
                nervous and endocrinal problems. Organic growers do not use toxic and artificial chemicals so you can
                rest assured that your food is chemical free.

                Use of soluble chemical fertilizers has resulted in high nitrate concentration in conventionally farmed
                food especially fruits and vegetables. The leaching of these fertilizers has also resulted in increasing
                nitrate contamination of drinking water systems across the world. Not only are these nitrates
                carcinogenic, they have even been known to impair the bloodâ€™s ability to carry oxygen. The nitrate
                content of organically grown food is significantly lower than in conventionally grown produce..

                Many people today complain about loss of food diversity in their everyday meals. The same is true even
                when they are eating outside. Many foods having mild flavours have lost their taste due to excessive
                emphasis on their quantity production and due to utter disregard for their quality parameters. Many food
                products in the past were consumed because of their strong flavours, but present day cultivation methods
                and commercial considerations have turned them into products with bitter tastes. Most commercial eating
                outlets deliver food with limited choices and are usually bland to taste. A large number of consumers
                have accepted the limited variety in choice of food. For any adventurous consumer, new choices are just
                not being offered by the market. Organic offers these very things.

        <p class="">
          While on one hand, the world is giving credence to the benefits of organic food, the scientific community on
          the other, holds it view that there is no evidence of a nutritional difference between conventional and
          organic food. Why then should anyone consume organic food? The motivation for consumers up till now is linked
          to the simple belief that organic food will at least not cause any harm, and they are quite correct in this
          regard.
