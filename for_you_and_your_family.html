          Today almost everyone is suffering from health problems related to stomach, indigestion, loss of energy,
          overall and general tiredness. When you compare the health and appetite of our ancestors and our previous
          generations, the difference is obvious. Almost all mothers complain that their children are not eating well
          enough. We feel heavy even if we’ve consumed small portions of food.
        </p>
        <p class="font-nunito">
          Almost everyday new scientific evidence is being produced that link many dreaded diseases such as diabetes,
          heart strokes, cancers, etc. to the food presently being produced and consumed. A large number of young
          professionals today gain weight even if they are eating very little. Surely the food we eat must have
          something to do with these issues.

        <h2 class="title mb-3">What Organic Food Really Means</h2>
        <p class="font-nunito">
          Organic food is a sincere attempt to improve the quality of life through the food we eat. While it is
          contamination-free in terms of toxic chemicals, it is also handled in a manner that makes it absolutely
          adulteration-free.
        </p>
        <p class="font-nunito">
          The certification process across the value chain requires that at each stage of cultivation, procurement,
          storage and processing is verified through third-party independent inspection and certification agencies.
          Organic food is sold in packed and sealed form with certification logos, making it one of the most closely
          monitored foods available today.

          Organic food is free from the potent cocktail of fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides and other chemicals
          that go into growing conventional produce. Chemical preservation methods are not allowed during storage,
          making organic food safer and healthier.

        <p class="font-nunito">
          There are many reasons for the worldwide acceptance of organic foods. Many find that organic food tastes
          better, as farmers use traditional seed varieties grown in naturally suitable areas, delivering authentic
          flavours rather than synthetic tastes.
        </p>
        <p class="font-nunito">
          Quality-conscious consumers willingly choose organic foods even if they are slightly more expensive,
          knowing that the best often comes at an extra cost.

      </div>

      <div class="col-lg-6 wow fadeInRight">
        <p class="font-nunito">
          In the last 20 years globally, and in the last decade in India, there has been a rapid rise in demand for
          certified organic food. Market surveys, consumer research and focused interviews consistently confirm this
          trend.

      While the scientific community debates nutritional differences between conventional and organic food, consumers
      increasingly choose organic based on the belief that it will not cause harm. This belief, grounded in safety
      and sustainability, continues to guide informed food choices.
