                            <p>
                                Food as a business, being a direct relationship between the producers and consumers for
                                thousands of years, underwent major transformation during the industrial revolution. It
                                become indirect, there were many multiple levels and above all the value chain
                                management of agriculture crops became so complex that it was not possible any more for
                                producer to directly reach out to consumers. While this offered many benefits to the
                                consumers in terms of regular availability, better products, more variety and
                                convenience, it also brought about distortion
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                in the trade, the major issue being lesser share for the producer as compared to
                                everyone else in the food value chain
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As of today the very idea of organic has been based on overcoming all the shortcomings
                                in the food value chain, beginning with the contamination in food, that too right from
                                cultivation onwards. It becomes imperative that the producer is involved in meeting the
                                increasing expectations of organic consumers. Thus when an organic crop is cultivated
                                and is being brought to the table of value, to the quality conscious

                            Fairtrade is an alternative approach to conventional trade and is based on a partnership
                            between producers and
                            consumers. Fairtrade offers farmers a better deal and improved terms of trade. This allows
                            them the opportunity
                            to improve their lives and plan for their future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Fair Trade label offers a positive way to buy products in solidarity with those who
                            produced them. Buying
                            Fairtrade products helps empower farmers and helps them tackle poverty.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Fair Trade certification is not just about paying farmers and workers fairly. Producers are
                            expected to trade
                            responsibly and respect and improve the lives of those who work with them, the communities
                            in which they work
