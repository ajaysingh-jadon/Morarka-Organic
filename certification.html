                                World over the concept of organic food has come about, due to demands from consumers for
                                food
                                without
                                contamination. This essentially means that on the farm synthetic and chemical inputs
                                should not
                                be used
                                for qualifying as an organic produce. In response to consumer demands, many countries
                                have
                                enacted
                                “laws” to regulate organic food production, handling and processing. These laws are
                                commonly
                                known as
                                “Organic Standards”.

                                understand how they ensure the authenticity of organic claims, it follows a prescribed

                            operate as independent third party verification. They are responsible for ensuring

                            Standards is issued a Certificate. This certificate authorizes the producer to put a stamp

                        most of the persons are not able to create an image of an Organic Food Producer. At Morarka

                                    certification bodies and standard setting organizations worldwide to develop their
                                    own certification standards and cannot be used for certification on their own.
                                    Together the IFOAM Basic standards for Organic Production and Processing (IBS) and
                                    the IFOAM Accreditation Criteria for Bodies Certifying Organic Production and
                                    Processing (IAC) constitute the IFOAM Norms. The IFOAM seal is a market oriented
                                    mark of compliance. The mark ensures wholesalers, retailers and consumers that a
                                    product and its producers are organically certified within the IFOAM Organic
                                    Guarantee System. However this being a private initiative, i.e., outside the laws of

                                    Program, the purpose of which is to protect the heath of consumers and ensure fair
                                    trade practices. The Codex Alimentarius is a collection of internationally adopted
                                    food standards. It also includes provisions of an advisory nature in the form of
                                    codes of practice, guidelines and other measures. It is intended to guide and
                                    promote the elaboration and establishment of definitions and requirement for foods,
                                    to assist their harmonization and in doing so, facilitate international trade. These
                                    guidelines define organic production and labelling in a manner that protects the
                                    consumer from products that falsely claim to be organic. In India, CFTRI Mysore has

                                    In the past organic farming practices were haphazardly regulated by a wide variety
                                    of governmental and private certification programs. To bring about uniformity, the
                                    Congress of the United States passed the Organic Food Production Act in 1990. The
                                    Act mandates the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish
                                    national standards governing the methods of organic production. The final rules
                                    which were effective from February 2001 established the National Organic Program
                                    (NOP) as an arm of the USDA. This program has been developed to facilitate domestic
                                    and international marketing of fresh and processed organic food, and assure
                                    consumers that such products meet consistent, uniform standards. The regulations
                                    among other things prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients, irradiation
                                    to decontaminate products, and sewage sludge as fertilizers for any food sold as an
                                    organic product. As of today the Organic Seal of NOP is one of the most recognized
                                    mark among the consumers, not only in the US but also across the world. All Morarka
                                    Products are also certified as per USDA ? NOP Standards.

                                    In Europe, initially most organic trade was based on Private Standards. There were
                                    many private agencies offering organic certification services, mostly based on IFOAM
                                    Standards. Their marks/logos were promoted and recognized by the consumers. However,
                                    when the trade was better regulated, European Commission came forward to formulate
                                    uniform standards applicable to all the countries in Europe. These were known as EU
                                    2091/92 standards for organic and a new Seal/Logo was extensively promoted and
                                    recognized. The EU standards achieved equivalence with US standards as well as with
                                    the ISO 65 norms. In some countries in Europe, like in UK, even today they have
                                    better recognized private standards by ?Soil Association?. At Morarka Organic the
                                    organic products are certified as per EU norms as well.

                                    agency to implement the Organic Standards. The National Programme for Organic
                                    Production was launched in March 2000. It contained Standards for organic products
                                    exports. The NPOP standards have mostly been based on provisions contained in
                                    Standards prescribed by Agencies such as IFOAM, EU regulations and Codex. The Indian
                                    NPOP Standards have also achieved equivalence with US & EU standards. All
                                    certification agencies operating in India have to be necessarily accredited, to
                                    certify as per NPOP standards, and thus all the projects and products from Morarka
