                                elaborate process. It involves both lab-based quality checks as well as process based

                                    The quality management at Morarka Organic begins with the selection of project areas
                                    for the cultivation of specific crops. Every effort is made to identify those areas,
                                    which are traditionally known for that crop in terms of its inherent quality
                                    attributes. This approach enables the best quality crop variety available for
                                    marketing and delivering superior sensory attributes like taste, aroma, flavour,
                                    cooking quality etc. It is also makes it much easier to take up the organic
                                    cultivation in traditional growing areas.

                                    <p>Safety of the food supply is the key to consumer confidence. In the past,
                                        periodic plant inspections and sample testing have been used to ensure the
                                        quality and safety of food products. HACCP was introduced as a system to control
                                        the safety of the product when manufactured, rather than trying to detect
                                        problems by testing the finished product.</p>
                                    <p>This system is based on assessing the inherent hazards or risks in a particular
                                        product or process and designing a system to control them. Specific points where
                                        the hazards can be controlled in the process are identified and monitored
                                        regularly to keep the Critical Control Points under control.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The HACCP system has been successfully applied in all the Production Units. The
                                        system fits in well with modern quality and management techniques. It is
                                        especially compatible with the ISO 22000 and just in time delivery of
                                        ingredients. In this environment, consumers are assured of receiving quality
                                        products matching their specifications

                                    <p>Food reaches consumers via supply chains that may link many different types of
                                        organizations and may stretch across multiple borders. A weak link may result in
                                        unsafe food, which is dangerous to consumers? health. ISO 22000 has made
                                        implementation of the HACCP system easier as it incorporates food hygiene
                                        principles of HACCP. Another benefit of ISO 22000 is that it extends the system
                                        management approach of ISO 9001:2000 which though widely implemented in all
