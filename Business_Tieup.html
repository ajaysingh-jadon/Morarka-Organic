                            to get in to this
                            industry very early, definitely much before it was even recognized as a business and or an
                            industrial activity by any one else in India. Even today there are very few and very small
                            players. It is still not on the radar of large business establishments. Being an industry
                            leader, Morarka Organic has always worked to create a conducive environment for the entry of
                            other players in this sector. As of today almost every business entity engaged in organic
                            agribusiness and having meaningful scale of operations, have some kind of
                            business/technology
                            /outreach collaboration with Morarka Organic. For this industry to achieve its due
                            recognition,
                            it will need to have many more players. This also reflects on our collaborative philosophy
                            and
                            we intend to strengthen this approach further in future.

                                <p>Internationally the organic industry has already become quite a big industry. With
                                    current global turnover touching about US $120 billion, and growing at an average of
                                    10-20 percent per year, it is already the fastest growing segment in overall food
                                    businesses.,</p>

                                <p> With the rapid rise in demand for organic products in many developed economies and
                                    more so in western countries, almost all the industry players there are now looking
                                    towards India to supply the organic products. </p>

                                <p>India has many advantages which can make it a global hub for supply of organic raw
                                    materials. India also enjoys many competitive advantages in many products, and has
                                    been a regular exporter of these items, of course produced under conventional
                                    agriculture. In times to come a large proportion of these items will get converted
                                    to certified organic products. As per the research data available with us, in terms
                                    of cost benefits, India is the 'least-cost' producer of over 185 food items. This
                                    can easily make India the global organic kitchen of the world. For any interested
                                    exporter in India and for any importer abroad, Morarka Organic will be very happy to
                                    give them access to its organic raw material cultivation - production base in India.
                                    This will facilitate them in early entry.</p>

                                <p>In addition to many raw products of immense interest to many international players,
                                    they are also looking for joining hands with Indian players to produce processed
                                    products also. Many of them will need fresh fruits & vegetables as raw materials.
                                    Many of them are willing to bring in new technologies and best practices for
                                    managing real world class organic agribusinesses. Morarka Organic has been getting
                                    many such offers and will be very happy to join hands with Indian Entrepreneurs take
                                    this forward.</p>

                                <p>Since organic is in its infancy in India, the interface between the consumers and the
                                    trade has not evolved as yet. The constant struggle between the traditional retail
                                    outlets vis-à-vis modern retail chains has taken a new dimension in the market
                                    place. In their efforts to outsmart each other many distortions have come in place,
                                    many of them at the cost of producers & quality of products as well. Apparently some
                                    of them appearing to be in favour of consumers may harm the consumer interests in
                                    the long run.</p>

                                <p>Most food commodities being managed by trade in India is undergoing major
                                    transformation. For long essential food items were sold with reasonable margins;
                                    today they are subjected to a price war one day and extraordinary premiums the next
                                    day. As a result, there is a new kind of confusion being created in the minds of
                                    consumers. The yardstick for quality is changing. In India commodity prices have
                                    always been linked to the quality of the produce, but today the understanding about
                                    the quality is not getting reflected in terms of price.</p>

                                <p>Many retail establishments expect very high margins, this increases the consumer
                                    costs. Many of them are afraid to answer the consumer about the quality of their
                                    traditional offerings vis-à-vis new organic offerings. In such a scenario the
                                    retailing of organic food products has become a challenge as well as a new
                                    opportunity. To overcome many of these shortcomings, Morarka Organic has been
                                    innovating on retailing options. It is constantly working hard to ensure that
                                    organic products are made available to consumers at most reasonable prices.</p>

                                <p>Presently, Morarka Organic is the first choice back-end supplier of organic products
                                    to a very large number of independent small retail outlets, selling in their own
                                    brands in about 100 cities & towns.</p>

                                <p>Many modern retail chains also source their entire organic offerings from Morarka
                                    Organic. 'Down To Earth' is already the single largest selling brand in India now.
                                </p>

                                <p>Morarka Organic is therefore looking to establish business tie-ups for experimenting
                                    with as many types of retail channel options as possible in joint association with
                                    anyone interested anywhere in India or abroad.</p>

                                <p>Every city has new as well as old food service establishments such as restaurants,
                                    hotels, sweet shops, catering organizations, bakeries, snack outlets, etc. They all
                                    have to face the constant threat of competition between them and especially from
                                    those who promote their products and brands more aggressively.</p>

                                <p>Organic being a new lifestyle option and a guarantee for food with the very best
                                    quality credentials, it makes sense to convert to organic. This will provide a
                                    unique positioning to the outlet, not so easily replicable, and will take the outlet
                                    much ahead of the competition.</p>

                                <p>Morarka Organic has evolved a complete support package for this set of
                                    establishments. It has a team of trained chefs, nutritionists, recipe development
                                    &amp; management experts to work hand in hand with the client organizations.</p>

                                <p>In its repository, besides all the conventional regularly required ingredients, it
                                    also has access to some very unique and or lesser known food ingredients that can
                                    help create unique tastes and aromas to the simple foods.</p>

                                <p>It also has a team of food scientists and experts to design and deliver tailor made
                                    equipments, processes and techniques for making your products better and better.</p>

                                <p>Morarka Organic has already achieved many laurels in last few years. In case of
                                    bakery products, organic ingredients alone have been able to increase their shelf
                                    life. A new blend of Diabetic Atta has become very popular among caterers. Many
                                    fruits &amp; vegetables after suitable processing have been able to reduce the
                                    overall costs of food. Many masala mixes have made retail food outlets to deliver
                                    unique tastes. And so on.</p>

                                <p>Morarka Organic is inviting the attention of the entire food retail establishments to
                                    join this unique campaign. We will provide all the support you have always been
                                    looking for, but which was never available.</p>
